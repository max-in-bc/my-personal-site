  <h1>Work Experience</h1>

  <p><strong><em>Brili Inc, Toronto, ON</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Lead Software Engineer, October 2016 - July 2017</strong></p>
  <p><strong>AngularJS Web App + Ionic Hybrid iOS/Android App</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brili is a Toronto start-up aimed at kids with learning disabilities
    (particularly ADHD and ASD) that hopes to provide a fun way to help them maintain their daily routines. Partnered
    with IBM and with over 6000 active users, I was the sole developer of this cloud-based, multi-platform solution
    that is an incalculable aid to struggling families across the world. The Angular web app that was developed into
    an Ionic-based Android/iOS app by my predecessor, was ready for a major scale-up when I arrived. I responded to
    and fixed bugs found by our users, implemented major new features and systems, as well as created/ran several
    NodeJS and Angular-based web apps and APIs on cloud platforms (such as Heroku and Bluemix) that our app used for
    a number of reasons (subscriptions, push notifications, etc). I undertook a massive overhaul of the system from
    client-based to an almost entirely cloud-based architecture in preparation for an upcoming new product.</span></p>

  <p><strong><em>Vandenpost Media, Toronto, ON</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Lead Technical Liaison, November 2015 - December 2017</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Google Analytics/Google Search Console/Google AdWords</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been the technical liaison at a social media relations start-up in Toronto.
    I have been the sole person in charge of all technical aspects of the new company including email, domain, and website
    administration, search engine optimization, Google AdWords campaign and Google Analytics manager, database engineer, as
    well as the lead on answering technical questions posed by our clients. I am now certified in AdWords as well as
    Analytics, and I have taught myself immeasurable amounts about SEO, email servers, domain name servers/management,
    social media relations, as well as the security and maintenance of running multiple interacting applications using
    cloud servers, particularly Amazon EC2 instances. In October of 2016 I stepped back from being full-time with Vandenpost, but
    and I was maintained as a consultant with the company until it's official dissolution in December of 2017.</span></p>

  <p><strong><em>IBM, Markham, ON</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Java Software Engineer (Intern), Summer 2013 &ndash; Fall 2014</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Java SE/EE Desktop Application</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TPF Toolkit is a Eclipse-based integrated development environment for remote creation,
    transfer, and compilation of TPF 4.1 and z/TPF applications that has been around since 2004. It was on my small 4-person
    team that I developed, debugged, tested, and maintained TPF Toolkit 4.0.3, 4.2.0, and 4.2.1. That means in my sixteen
    month internship I was involved in all of the stages of a scrum-like, agile development cycle. During this time I was
    tasked also with setting up automated regression testing using Rational Functional Tester for each of the new features.
    During my final iteration I was tasked with making a new Eclipse view for the system, which was a feature that I was
    proud to have listed on the marketing literature for that release. </span></p>

My team was involved with the design, creation, and integration of the backend system for the website. The project is still growing in support and can be accessed at</span><a href="http://farm-to-fork.ca/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">http://farm-to-fork.ca/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

  <h1>Strengths</h1>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong> Charity: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was through fundraising for charities such
      as Plan International that I decided I want to dedicate my life to helping those less fortunate. Currently
      I am ready to become the best software engineer I can be, so that I can be most effective in my future charitable
      endeavors. </span></li>

    <li><strong>Assorted project experience:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I have experience with agile
      development frameworks such as scrum, and I have worked on a number of different types of personal and professional
      projects including hybrid mobile apps, scalable web applications, RESTful APIs, 3D games, a custom IDE, and a ton
      of fun projects with my Arduinos and Raspberry Pis.</span></li>

    <li><strong>Languages and Protocols:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;C/C++, Java, HTML5/CSS3,
      JavaScript (and many major libraries and frameworks such as Node, Angular, React, and JQuery), Python
      (including frameworks like Pyramid and Django), Assembly (HLAsm in particular), PHP, Perl, AppleScript,
      most standard data representation protocols (such as JSON and XML), lots of backend experience (SQL, mongoDB,
      as well as other online noSQL services) as well as many revisions of legacy languages such as FORTRAN, COBOL,
      and Ada.</span></li>

    <li><strong>Google Certified: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a certified Google Analytics IQ
      partner, as well as a Google AdWords IQ partner. I have become comfortable with running AdWords campaigns

  <h1>Education</h1>
  
  <p><strong><em>University of Guelph, Guelph, ON</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Software Engineering Undergraduate, Fall 2010 &ndash; Summer 2015</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just my first year of learning the C language I had programmed a client/server
    chat client as well as a fully functional &ldquo;Rogue&rdquo;-like game. Since then I have developed a number of
    projects through my education, including a P2P tic-tac-toe game, a 3D flying game, a custom bash shell, a music
    collection website, a Python and C-based MARCXML parser, and many more. I have also studied algorithms,
    time-complexity, and complex theories of computing and language that have shaped my approach to software engineering.
    Other topics include legacy languages, modern techniques in parallel programming, as well as image processing. In my
    final year I was a teaching assistant for introductory computer classes for which I was employed to help students,
    invigilate tests, and mark assignments.</span></p>
