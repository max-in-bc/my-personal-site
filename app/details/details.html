    <p class="summary-body"><span>{{"Brili is a Toronto start-up aimed at kids with learning disabilities (particularly ADHD and ASD) that hopes to provide a fun way to help them maintain their daily routines. Partnered with IBM and with over 6000 active users, I was the sole developer of this cloud-based, multi-platform solution that is an incalculable aid to struggling families across the world. The Angular web app that was developed into an Ionic-based Android/iOS app by my predecessor, was ready for a major scale-up when I arrived. I responded to and fixed bugs found by our users, implemented major new features and systems, as well as created/ran several NodeJS and Angular-based web apps and APIs on cloud platforms (such as Heroku and Bluemix) that our app used for a number of reasons (subscriptions, push notifications, etc). I undertook a massive overhaul of the system fromclient-based to an almost entirely cloud-based architecture in preparation for an upcoming new product. " | limitTo: textLimit}}</span>
