# Max Gardiner (programmer) - `personal-site`

This site is just a simple way to display my skills, experience,
and possibly some personal projects. I am making the project public
in case you are interested in looking under the hood!

Located at http://maxthecoder.ca

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone this repository and install the dependencies easily:
```
git clone https://github.com/maxgardiner/personal-site.git
cd personal-site
yarn
```

### Run the Application

The simplest way to start this server is:

```
yarn start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].

```
ctrl + c to end the server and kill the scss watcher
```


### Prerequisites

This project was initially built on a barebones skelaton, called `angular-seed`.
Running and testing my site also uses a number of Node.js tools, as well as all
of the barebones angular tools included with the  `angular-seed` project. You
must have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].
* In order to run the end-to-end tests, you will also need to have the
  [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] installed on your machine.

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
`angular-seed` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file. Putting it in the `app` folder
makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.*

### Running the App Locally

This project comes preconfigured with a local development web server. It is a Node.js
tool called [http-server][http-server]. You can start this web server with `yarn start`

`yarn start` takes care of starting/stopping the following:
- The web server (at localhost:8000)
- The NodeJS API server (at localhost:3000)
- The mongoDB server ued by the api (at localhost:12071)
- The SASS watcher that converts SASS files to CSS on the fly while developing (localhost:8621)

A development/production environment will be available eventually, currently this project is only under development. Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own web server, such as Apache or Nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.
